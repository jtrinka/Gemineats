Gemineats is a user-friendly app that leverages custom prompt engineering, Google's Gemini-pro large language multimodal AI model, and streamlit to offer delicious, unique, and fun recipes sure to wow family and guests. This repository contains the software that is used for prompt engineering, standing up the Google API, and defining the streamlit app. The app is hosted [here](https://gemineats.streamlit.app/).

## Core Features

The base prompt that is leveraged in Gemineats specifies that the Gemini-pro model is to act as a meal recommendation engine and should return an answer in a template form. The app then offers the following two types of prompting that accompany the base prompt:

    1. Recommended Prompt - Leverages user selections and under-the-hood prompt engineering to make a meal recommendation
    2. Custom Prompt - Leverages exact user input with the base prompt in the meal recommendation

### Recommended Prompt Features

The recommended prompt feature offers the following options to the user:

    * Relevant Allergies - Causes Gemineats to make a meal recommendation that avoids the specified food allergies
    * Food Styles - Causes Gemineats to make a meal recommendation that leverages certain styles of food
    * List of Available Ingredients - Causes Gemineats to make a meal recommendation that leverages specified ingredients
    * Requesting a Nonalcoholic Drink Pairing - Causes Gemineats to make a meal recommendation that includes a nonalcoholic drink pairing that goes with the food
    * Requesting an Alcoholic Drink Pairing - Causes Gemineats to make a meal recommendation that includes an alcoholic drink pairing that goes with the food

### Custom Prompt Features

The custom prompt feature simply leverages the base prompt and the user input to make a meal recommendation.
